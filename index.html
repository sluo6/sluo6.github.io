              <p>I received my PhD in <b>pharmacognosy</b>, studying biologically active <b>natural products</b> from
                  <b>cyanobacteria</b>, using methods such as MS spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. I am on my way towards a
              master's degree in <b>computer science</b>. I believe that by combining perspectives and methodologies
              obtained from computer science into pharmacognosy research, novel discoveries are going to blossom!</p>
