## Hiding Data

Weakly private attributes and methods are named using `_attibute` or `_method` convention.
Weakly private variables CAN be accessed from outside of class.
`from module import *` won't import variables named as `_variable`.

Strongly private attributes are named using `__attribute`. They can not be accessed directly from outside class.
To access variable `__a` of class `b` from outside class, syntax `_b__a` should be used.
